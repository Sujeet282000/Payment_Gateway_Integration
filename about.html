                    <h2>"Primary Education"</h2>
                    <p>
                        20 Million children in India do not go to school. Millions of children are still denied their right to education because of poverty. Donate for the education of poor children and support them with necessities like tuition fees, school supplies, footwear, transport, etc. Help them build a future that will make them escape poverty passed from generation to generation.

                       <i>Our foundation  has been working for 25 years to ensure quality elementary education for children, especially girls and those from marginalized communities, to help them become the leaders and changemakers of the future. We see education as an imperative tool for girls to realize their maximum potential by gaining crucial skills and dispositions that set them on the path of social and economic empowerment.

                        Our programmes and projects work through building learning ecosystems that are inclusive, gender conscious, and safe for all. Our education initiatives work in accordance with the Right to Education Act (2009) and National Education Policy 2020.
                        Yesterday, we successfully ended with our campaign. With all your support and our hard-work we collected â‚¹20,612. We cannot express our gratitude and appreciation towards you all through words as it would be less enough to do so. We are grateful to have the support of people like you. World needs more people like you. Because of you all we were able to bring 1% change in the society. And hopefully with all your support we shall continue to do such noble works for the society.
                        Thank you for all your love and support towards a better cause
